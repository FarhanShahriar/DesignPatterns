1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Problem:
You are developing a class for User Management in a web application. The class is responsible for:

Storing user details (name, email, etc.).
Validating user input (e.g., checking if the email is in the correct format).
Saving the user to the database.
Sending a welcome email to the user after registration.
You notice that the User class is responsible for multiple tasks: data storage, validation, database operations, and email sending. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, as the class has more than one reason to change.

Task: Refactor the code to ensure that each class has only one responsibility.
