4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Problem:
You are designing a system for different types of printers. Thereâ€™s a Printer interface that includes the following methods:

print()
scan()
fax()
However, not all printers support all these operations. For instance, a basic printer only needs the print() method, while a multi-function printer requires all methods.

Currently, every printer class has to implement all three methods, even if they do not need to (e.g., a basic printer needs to provide an empty implementation for scan() and fax()), violating the Interface Segregation Principle.

Task: Refactor the Printer interface so that classes implement only the methods they need, adhering to the ISP.
